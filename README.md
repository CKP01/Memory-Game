## Project Overview
The objective of this project is to design a matching game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

## Gameplay
- The time will start once the first card has been clicked
- The number of moves will increase when two cards have been toggled
- The number of stars will decrease after certain amount of moves
- The game will display a 'Game Over' modal once all the cards have been matched
- Try matching the cards in the shortest amount of time with few moves. Have fun! :smile:
